## Ingredients 

- 100g unsweeted chocolate. I use [Lindt Edelbitter Mild](https://www.lindt.de/catalog/product/view/id/6628/) 70-90% (full bar), but you can use whatever you like.
- 2/3 cup (150g) unsalted butter
- 3 eggs
- 1 tablespoon pure vanilla
- 1/2 teaspoon (a pinch) salt
- 2 tablespoons (20g) Baking Powder
- 1 cup (200g) dark brown sugar.
- 1 cup (240ml) whole milk.
- 2/3 cup (150g) flour.


## Method

1) Prepare your baking dish. Rub with a thin layer of butter and dust with flour covering the entire surface. Knock the side swiftly to dislodge excess flour. 
1) Melt the butter and chocolate together in a bowl over simmering water. 
2) Mix the sugar in.
3) Let the bowl cool. Sometimes I put it in a cool water bath when I am impatient. :)
4) Thoroughly whisk in eggs, vanilla, milk and salt.
5) Add the flour and baking powder. Quickly until uniformly combined. Batter consistency should be just liquid enough to where drips from the spoon almost keep their shape when landing on the surface. If the drops disappear, it's too wet (add some flour). If they are too clumpy, add some milk. More milk will make it more moist, but too much can lead to a cake that rises and collapses at the end. 
6) Pour the batter into the baking disk. 
7) Bake @ 350 for 30-40 mins. Time entirely depends on your baking dish shape/depth. The deeper, the longer the cook will take. You will see cake rising as it cooks. When it's done, you might see the rising stop and a slight sinkage. If you see that, you're done!
8) Let cake cool before turning over the form (if using a Bundt cake form or similar).
